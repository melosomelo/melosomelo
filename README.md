# Hi, I'm Mateus! 👋🏼

I'm a brazilian full-stack developer working at IBM and a computer science
student at
[UFRN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Rio_Grande_do_Norte).

To me, living is about constantly learning, evolving and improving one's
understanding about the world. My main goal as a software engineer is to create
elegant solutions that provide value to the people that use them.
